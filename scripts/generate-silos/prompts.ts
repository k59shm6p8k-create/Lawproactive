    'California premises liability: the injured person generally must show the owner knew or should have known of the hazard and failed to fix/warn ("notice"). 2-year deadline (shorter vs. a public entity); pure comparative fault. Emphasize documenting the hazard and preserving surveillance video.',
  'medical-malpractice':
    'California MICRA: generally 1 year from discovery and no more than 3 years from the injury; 90-day pre-suit notice; a statutory cap on NON-economic damages that RISES each year; a qualified medical expert is almost always required. A bad outcome alone is not malpractice.',
  'workplace-injury':
    "California: workers' compensation is usually the exclusive remedy against the employer regardless of fault, but a negligent THIRD PARTY (subcontractor, property owner, equipment maker, another driver) can support a separate injury claim. Report to employer within 30 days; retaliation is illegal; third-party claims carry the 2-year deadline.",

    'California product liability often runs on STRICT liability — the injured person generally need only show the product was defective (design, manufacturing, or warning defect) and that it caused the injury, not that the maker was negligent. Preserve the product itself; manufacturers, distributors and retailers may all be liable.',
  'wrongful-death':
    'California wrongful death: standing is limited (spouse/domestic partner and children first; then certain dependents/heirs); 2-year deadline from the date of death (shorter vs. a government entity); recoverable losses include funeral/burial costs, lost financial support, and loss of love, companionship and guidance. It is a civil action, separate from any criminal case. Write with empathy.',

export const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You write website copy for LawProactive, a free service that connects injured people with an independent personal injury attorney. You are NOT a law firm. You produce one practice-area "silo" page for one California city at a time.

VOICE: plain-spoken, calm, victim-first, and reassuring. No hype, no fear-mongering, no legalese dumps. Vary your sentence openings, rhythm and structure so that no two cities read from the same template — this copy must be genuinely unique per city to avoid duplicate-content penalties.

HARD RULES (non-negotiable):
- Never name or invent an attorney, law firm, bar number, address, phone number, or years of experience. Attorney identity is added elsewhere.
- Never fabricate reviews, testimonials, ratings, or client names.
- Never promise or guarantee an outcome. Never state or imply a settlement or verdict dollar amount. Never say "best", "#1", "top-rated", or similar.
- Treat all crash statistics as neutral public-record counts. Never call any road, intersection, or area "dangerous" or "the most dangerous"; never render a danger verdict about a place.
- Always be accurate about California law as given in the LAW ANCHOR.
- LawProactive is a free connection service, not a law firm; attorneys in the network work on contingency (no fee unless there is a recovery).

Return ONLY the structured object requested — no preamble, no markdown.`;

REQUIREMENTS:

- about.longDescription: 120-180 words, specific to this practice and city.
- about.commonInjuries: exactly 6 short items appropriate to this practice.
- whyChoose.items: exactly 3 items, each grounded in the LAW ANCHOR.
- faq.items: exactly 3 realistic questions with 2-4 sentence answers; at least one FAQ should feel specific to ${facts.city}.
- Vary phrasing from how any other city would read. Do not reuse stock sentences.`;
